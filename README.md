# desklight

My home workstation is an ikea standing desk with a custom top, 138cm wide. The two 32" monitors occupy the entire width of the desk so there's no real space to put a light for detailed work. It can't really hang from the ceiling or wall either as the desk moves up and down. So this is a custom light bar which mounts to the monitor stands already present on the desk and extends over the monitors.

## Parts list

Needed for assembling the light
 * 2x pipeclamp-large
 * 2x pipeclamp-small
 * 2x bent-coupler
 * 2x lightbar-dock
 * 2x lightbar-endcap
 * 1x lightbar-coupler
 * 2x 50cm covered alu frame + led strip
 * 2x XXcm electrical pipe
 * 2x XXcm electrical pipe
 * 12v PSU
 * cabling

Assembly: pipeclamps attach to the monitor stands, small + large affixed with tie-wraps. Two lightbars coupled with coupler,  wires stick out from center hole in the coupler. Attach docks to each of the lightbars, positioned at the same distance as the two pipeclamps (75cm). End caps go on the end of the lightbar. Attach wire, thread through one of the docks. Insert electrical pipe in dock, thread wire. attach bent coupler + another pipe, thread wire. Insert into pipe clamps. Hook up PSU and test.

## models

I used this project to learn openscad so all models are made in there. I've included both the .scad and .stl files.

## Todo
 - [ ] First assembly
 - [ ] conceal wiring
 - [ ] replace two lightbars with a single one, 35-40 degree light output
 - [ ] replace electrical pipe with small diameter aluminium tube
