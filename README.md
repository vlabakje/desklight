# desklight

My home workstation is an ikea standing desk with a custom top, 138cm wide. The two 32" monitors occupy the entire width of the desk so there's no real space to put a light for detailed work. It can't really hang from the ceiling or wall either as the desk moves up and down. So this is a custom light bar which mounts to the monitor stands already present on the desk and extends over the monitors.

## Parts list

Needed for assembling the light
 * 2x pipeclamp-large
 * 2x pipeclamp-small
 * 2x bent-coupler
 * 2x lightbar-dock
 * 2x lightbar-endcap
 * 1x lightbar-coupler
 * 2x 50cm covered alu frame + led strip
 * 12v PSU

## models

I used this project to learn openscad so all models are made in there. I've included both the .scad and .stl files.
